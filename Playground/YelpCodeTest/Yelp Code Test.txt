For yelp search we need to highlight document snippets that match a query. For 
example a yelp search for [deep dish pizza] returns documents that match the 
query as well as highlights that try to show why the document is relevant. 
(http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=deep+dish+pizza&ns=1&rpp=10&find_lo
c=San+Francisco%2C+CA ).  Note that highlights (1) highlight all the words in 
the query and (2) are not necessarily the full document (they are 
instead only a relevant snippet). 
 
For this question you will write a function that finds the most relevant snippet for 
a document and highlights all the query terms that appear in the snippet 
(basically the highlights you saw on the linked search page). 
It is up to you to define what constitutes a good snippet and how big the snippets 
will be. 
 
Indicate highlights by surrounding the text to be highlighted with [[HIGHLIGHT]] 
... [[ENDHIGHLIGHT]].   
For instance "Little star's deep dish pizza sure is fantastic." would look like "Little 
star's [[HIGHLIGHT]]deep dish pizza[[ENDHIGHLIGHT]] sure is fantastic." 
internally. 
 
One highlighting example might be: 
highlight_doc("I like fish.  Little star's deep dish pizza sure is fantastic. Dogs are 
funny.", "deep dish pizza") -> "Little star's [[HIGHLIGHT]]deep dish 
pizza[[ENDHIGHLIGHT]] sure is fantastic." 
Note that your highlighter doesn't have to have the exact same result on this 
example, since *you* are defining what a good snippet is. 
!
The solution can be in any language (but python is preferred). Attach your native 
source files (.py, .java, .cpp, etc...). Hint: Write your code as if your peers may be 
maintaining your code. Your code should be as if it were for a production 
environment. And don't forget to include unit tests! 
 
I would like a function with the signature similar to the following: 
 
def highlight_doc(doc, query): 
   """ 
   Args: 
      doc - String that is a document to be highlighted 
      query - String that contains the search query 
 
  Returns: 
      The the most relevant snippet with the query terms highlighted. 
  """!
