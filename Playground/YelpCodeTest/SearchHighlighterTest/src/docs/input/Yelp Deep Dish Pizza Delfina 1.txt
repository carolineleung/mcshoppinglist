 big "mmmmmm" goes to Pizzeria Delfina. You are the newest best thing in my book.

SF's 7x7 list has been on a roll lately with great things. First, the yummy Belgian beer at Monk's Kettle, next the Salted Caramel ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery, and now the best thin crust pizza at Pizzeria Delfina. I love them all!

For deep dish, I think of Little Star's classic pizza. Now for thin crust, I immediately think of Pizzeria Delfina.  

The pizza tastes amazing & completely delicious, a few notches above perfect (if that's even possible) is actually more like it. Maybe the fact that I wasn't expecting to be wowed, wowed me even more. 

The tomato-based margherita pizza was lovely & simple, topped with fior di latte mozzarella & basil. http://www.yelp.com/bi...

The prosciutto pie, although not a pie, was the best pizza of the night. It had thin slices of prosciutto di parma, mozzarella, panna, & lots and lots of arugula. http://www.yelp.com/bi...iA21UVq5sWw

The combination of both pizzas was amazing. They complemented each other perfectly. I can't wait to come back & try the Salsiccia (has fennel sausage) and Panna (cream-based) pizzas.

As for the cozy restaurant, it was pretty crowded. However, they are very organized with their operations, workers are extremely personable & friendly, and you can easily order a glass of wine to enjoy outside as you wait. 

Be patient, the food is definitely worth the wait.
