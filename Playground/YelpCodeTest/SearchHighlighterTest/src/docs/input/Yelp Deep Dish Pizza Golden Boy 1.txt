neither here nor there....

definitely not thin crust, or ny style pizza, but square 'deep dish' pizza, well not really deep dish either....

little star is way better for deep dish. even BJ's is deep dish. this is NOT deep dish pizza.....

i came here thinking it was super delish b/c of its 200+ reviews and their strong 4 star average. 

mehhh.... i should have looked at the reviews harder before i went, looks like their reviews are mostly from people who love eating their pizza when they are NOT sober, or suffering from a hangover.

well, no wonder it wasn't that great when i went....

service was attentive, the place is plastered with stuff everywhere. it has character. 

pizza here is WAAAAAAY better than some of the places on broadway thats for sure.

CASH ONLY!!!!
