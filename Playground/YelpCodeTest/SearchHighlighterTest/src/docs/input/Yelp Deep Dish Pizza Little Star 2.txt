Went here for my friend's 23rd birthday, and as a pizza enthusiast,  this is one of the best pizza joints I have ever been to. 

Let me start off first by saying that I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5, only because of the wait. We got there around 6:30, and did not get seated until 7:45 or so. But if I had read the reviews, I should have seen that coming in haha. Plus, we had a party of 8.

We ordered the Classic Deep Dish Pizza, and the Pesto Based Thin Crust Pizza.
