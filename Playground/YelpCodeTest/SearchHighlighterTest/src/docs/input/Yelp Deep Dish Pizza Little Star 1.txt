Went here for my friend's 23rd birthday, and as a pizza enthusiast,  this is one of the best pizza joints I have ever been to. 

Let me start off first by saying that I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5, only because of the wait. We got there around 6:30, and did not get seated until 7:45 or so. But if I had read the reviews, I should have seen that coming in haha. Plus, we had a party of 8.

We ordered the Classic Deep Dish Pizza, and the Pesto Based Thin Crust Pizza.

The Classic Deep Dish was super super good! I had one bite of the crust, and I was in heaven. The crust was probably the best pizza crust I had ever eaten. The toppings were plentiful, and fresh.

The Pesto Based pizza was pretty good, but if I ever come here again, I would definitely recommend sticking to the deep dish. Man... I'm craving pizza just thinking about the crust....

Oh yeah btw, the crust is amazing here.

P.S. Oh yeah, did I mention the crust?
