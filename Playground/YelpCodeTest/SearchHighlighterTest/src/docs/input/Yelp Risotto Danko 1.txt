Gary Danko was the one that started it all for me about 7 years ago.  He was the one to start me on my food frenzy. I had eaten and eaten well, but never like that.  So when I missed my chance to make a reservation last year, I vowed to make it happen this year.

Meh...

It is not the same level it use to be.  At this level of restaurant, service and food should be stellar.  Neither rose to the occasion.

My husband and I had 4 courses each and not one dish was memorable. Don't get me wrong. I love food and I wanted more than anything else to LOVE Danko, but I didn't. I had:

- foie gras - good but not better than anywhere else I've had it. 
- lobster risotto - well cooked, fresh but not any better than a local joint that does risotto in dallas
- frog legs - salty
- pork belly/tenderloin  - pork belly is always awesome in my book, but the whole plate didn't go together. I'm a big believer that everything served on a plate should compliment and enhance each other.

Service was average at best.  My glass went dry TWICE and we actually had to flag someone to fill it (note:  I only had to have my glass filled twice)  And it was so LOUD. You can't expect to have a conversation and we actually like loud restaurants.

So would I go again? If someone else is paying.  There are too many great restaurants in SF to pay for a meal here.
